I am a final year PhD Student in Computer Science at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur working in Computational Linguitics under the supervision of Prof. Arnab Bhattacharya.

During my PhD, I have developed algorithms for several Computational Historical Linguistic problems namely phonological reconstruction, cognate detection and statistical testing of genetic relationship among languages employing language models and other techiniques largely inspired by Evolutionary Biology. I am also currently working on Low Resource Natural Language Understanding in case of Sanskrit using LLMs. ([<u>Research Statement</u>](/assets/pdf/Research_Statement.pdf))

I shall be joining Prof. Gerhard Jäger's project [Phylomilia](https://profgerhard.de/phylomilia/) as a Postdoctoral Researcher at University of Tübingen starting from around this November.
