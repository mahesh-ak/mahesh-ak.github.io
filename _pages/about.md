I am a Postdoctoral Researcher under the supervision of Prof. Gerhard Jäger at University of Tübingen working on Speech processing for Historical Linguistic applications.
 
Previously, I did PhD in Computer Science at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur where I had worked in Computational Linguitics under the supervision of Prof. Arnab Bhattacharya. During my PhD, I developed algorithms for several Computational Historical Linguistic problems namely phonological reconstruction, cognate detection and statistical testing of genetic relationship among languages employing language models and other techiniques largely inspired by Evolutionary Biology. I also worked on Low Resource Natural Language Understanding in Sanskrit and other Classical Languages using LLMs.
